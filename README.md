# Postfix-Arithmetic-Interpretor
Postfix calculator designed to do postfix caluculations
a calculator that takes in Postfix Notation of values between 0-9 and spits out the calculations. This was done as a personal project to show my knowledge of the C language.
The file can be compiled and run on IDE's like Putty.
